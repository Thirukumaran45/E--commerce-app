E-Commerce App is a mobile shopping platform that allows users to browse products, manage their cart, and make purchases seamlessly. Users can sign up and log in, view product details, add items to the cart, and see a real-time calculation of total cost, delivery charges, and GST. The app uses Provider state management for reactive updates, ensuring that any changes in the cart or user data are instantly reflected in the UI. Data is stored locally using a JSON-based StorageService, making it lightweight and easy to manage.
